// teacher_name = st.selectbox("Select Teacher", ["drvinay", "lewas", "historyoftech"])

//concern:
i ssume if the current language is for example punjabi and the user wants to switch back to englisgh, maybe it is not full 100% correct, what if if we return from the backend the required language and the english base as well. oR IT WILL BE FINE TO CHANGE THE LANGUAGE IN THE FRONTEND AND IT WILL WORK.

//Add transaltion to frontend as well

//use an api for transalation
